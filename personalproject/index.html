      <h2>MEETING ONE</h2>
      <h3> April 4, 2019 </h3>
      <p> First, it would benefit me because I could take this opportunity to learn more about web design and development, as well as Realtime data-basing for websites and hosting a public server. Second, it would benefit others as my website/app will help students struggling on specific subjects to improve because they can use notes and assignments from other users as this is one feature of my site. </p> <p>The project is a form of self-learning and a study aid material online which other students can access. Logins and other features will prevent students from posting material that will negatively impact other people. Overall, my project will help many other students.</p><p>I chose the global context of fairness and equality. This is because not all children have access to quality education. Some may not have a chance to learn as sports, finances, and social problems may prevent them from receiving good education. My project will help users in those situations as good education is a right everyone should have.</p><p>My goal is definitely challenging because I have not had any experience with coding websites that uses a database or hosts serves that are accessed throughout. I also do not know much about JavaScript in programming therefore I would like to use this chance to learn more about these subjects.This project is important to both me (in terms of a learning aspect) and communities where good education cannot be accessed (helping others and providing everyone a chance for fair education). </p> <p> Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16yYeqspTDMo4kpuSQpKpkUWZawGKhf0Qgay5tD6UFRA/edit?usp=sharing" style="padding-left:0px; text-decoration: underline;">here</a> to access the document for meeting one. </p>

      <h2>IDEA DEVELOPING</h2>
      <h3> March 28, 2019 </h3>
      <p> My personal project idea is to create a website where children can access learning tools and notes as a help to those who do not have access to quality education. </p>
