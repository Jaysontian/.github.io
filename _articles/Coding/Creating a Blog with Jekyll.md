Have some experience with basic web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and interested in coding a blog? This is the article! [Jekyll][1] is a **static site generator** for personal or professional sites. It’s a framework written in Ruby and renders Markdown and Liquid templates into web pages. 

If that explanation means absolutely nothing to you, have no fear! It’s really just programming jargon that explains how Jekyll works:
- **Ruby** is just a programming language used to build frameworks. You don’t really need to worry about it other than understand that you need to **install** ruby to use Jekyll. (Explained later, but If you want to learn more, read [Ruby’s Docs][2])
- What is a **static site generator**? Normally, blogs are hosted from a backend server. This requires you to have articles stored in a cloud and then your website will fetch that data. On the other hand, Jekyll hosts all your files live from folders that code your site, so it becomes super easy to start a blog and update it! Many people use Github to host their Jekyll blogs, but you can use whatever you want.
- **Markdown** is a text editing language. Just like text files (.txt), markdown has its own formatting and allows easy styling. For example, you can use \* to make words bold and dashes (-) to create a bullet list. These are the files that blog articles and posts will be written in. Once in the folder, Jekyll will generate the markdown files into live HTML pages for the site.
