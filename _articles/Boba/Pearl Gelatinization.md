What is so good about tapioca? Is it the addicting chewiness of its texture or its sweet, savoury flavor? Regardless which it is for you, I recently did an investigation into what makes tapioca so peculiar as a topping within beverages.

*How can we adjust its recipes and ingredients to obtain the best tapioca? Let’s find out!*

The bubbles in bubble tea are made from tapioca flour, which is a starch. Unlike wheat flour, which contains starches, protein and fiber, tapioca flour contains *only* starch. And the secret to making bubbles lies in the way starch particles interact with water.

Starch particles are created when a large number of glucose (a form of sugar) units join together. When these particles are mixed with cold water they disperse and float around in the water. This type of mixture is called a suspension, and the suspension of starch in cold water is often referred to as goo or Oobleck. Note that the starch particles do not change when mixed with cold water. When you leave the goo out the water will eventually evaporate and you will have your starch particles again.

The story changes when you add heat. Starch particles swell and break apart when mixed with hot water. The smaller pieces then create new connections and form a network that can hold water. This process is called starch gelatinization. When this solution cools it becomes more gel-like. With time it will lose water and become stiffer. But no matter how long you wait it will not turn into starch particles again. The addition of heat changed the particles.
