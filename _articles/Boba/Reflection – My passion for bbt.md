Even though I realize the drinks are expensive, and that drinking it all the time is a waste of money and incredibly unhealthy, it’s not about the “taste” nor the “flavour” I’m truly seeking for. I’m actually quite stingy when making superfluous purchases, anything unessential – shoes, clothing, devices I avoid or try to purchase minimally. But I think the reason I’m **willing** and **oblivious** to spending so much on bbt is the simple fact that it brings joy to me in many ways – sharing it over a table with close friends, drinking it as I play beach volleyball on a summer beach day, driving by myself to Chatime and buying it for my sister – just as a statement to demonstrate my appreciation and maturity. I think it’s these experiences where I can connect and grow that makes me attached to this simple “drink”. It’s not just tea, sugar, and cream; it’s a fusion of experiences and emotions that is difficult to recreate as we all grow older.

As cringe as it as, I believe I will definitely forget what each drink tastes like, or whatever I did that day, but I will never forget how  the shared moment of trying a new drink made me feel, with the people I love around me.
