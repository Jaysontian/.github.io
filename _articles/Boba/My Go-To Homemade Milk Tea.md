The secret – keep it simple. Of course, you can customize it however you want but it’s *essential* to have the base ingredients right along with a good ratio between them (depending on how you like it).

A simple milk tea composes of 3 elements:

1. **Tea** (Different varieties depending on what you like)
2. **Creamer** also preference based, but serves to give the milk tea a richer smoother texture and also counteracts the bitterness of some tea types
3. **Sugar** (optional)

Now the process is where it gets complicated. There are many interesting ways you can make the milk tea. I list a few methods below, along with their pros / cons / features:

## Milk Steeping

Yes, normal people steep their tea with water. But if you’re feeling a bit lucky or want to stand out, steep your tea with milk!

1. Heat your milk (I usually use 2%) and bring it to a boil. Remove the skin of the milk (fun fact it’s called “*lactoderm*”) and pour it into your tea bag.
2. If you have tea leaves, just drop the tea leaves in and **stir**. Do not let it sit there or else it burns and turns black (I speak from personal experience).

This allows the tea flavours to fuse directly into the milk. If you prefer a creamier tea, this is the method you should try.
