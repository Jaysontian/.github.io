The secret – keep it simple. Of course you can customize it however you want but it’s so important to have the base ingredients and get their ratios right (depending on how you like it).

A simple milk tea composes of 3 elements:

1. **Tea** (Different varieties depending on what you like)
2. **Creamer** also preference based, but serves to give the milk tea a richer smoother texture and also counteracts the bitterness of some tea types
3. **Sugar** (optional)

Now the process is where it gets complicated. There are many interesting ways you can make the milk tea. Below are a few and their pros / cons:

## Milk Steeping

Normal people steep their tea with water. Well, if you’re feeling a bit lucky or want to stand out, steep your tea with milk!
Heat your milk (I usually use 2%) and bring it to a boil. Remove the skin of the milk (fun fact it’s called “*lactoderm*”) and pour it into your tea bag.
If you have tea leaves, just drop the tea leaves in and **stir**. Do not let it sit there or else it burns and turns black (I speak from personal experience).
