Bubble tea drinks are expensive. That is a fact. With some reflection and also comments from friends recently, I’ve been reflecting on why I drink so much and why I’m not concerned it’s going to make me go broke. 

Although I realize the drinks are quite overpriced, and that over drinking it is a waste of money and incredibly unhealthy, I’ve realized how it’s not about the “taste” nor the “flavour” that I really care about.

I’m actually quite stingy when making superfluous purchases. Anything unessential – shoes, clothing, and devices (that normal teenagers **do** care about) – I try to avoid or consume minimally. But I think the reason I’m **willing** and **oblivious** to spend so much on bbt is the simple fact that it brings joy to me in so many ways. In retrospect, I’ve enjoyed the mere experiences over the actual drink itself: sharing it over discussion with friends, drinking it as I play volleyball on a summer day, driving by myself to a shop and buying it for my sister, just as a “statement” to demonstrate my appreciation and maturity. I think it’s these moments of connection and intimacy that makes me so attached to this simple “drink”.  It’s not just tea, sugar, and cream. It’s a fusion of experiences and emotions that is difficult to recreate as we all grow older.

As cringe as it as, I believe I will definitely forget what each drink tastes like, or whatever I did that day, but I will never forget how  the shared moment of trying a new drink made me feel, with the people I love around me.
