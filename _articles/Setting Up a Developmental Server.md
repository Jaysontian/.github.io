Welcome to my new page for testing things. I think that it’s important that we think of many things and then test it out. For example, this list:
- What should we do?
- I don’t know!
- I am scared!

And also numbered lists:
1. There are things going on that I don’t know of
2. What is happening?

And finally, there are [links!]() and annotations!

## Server Mode
You might be wondering what server models. Basically, it determines everything.
