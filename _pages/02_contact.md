# About Me


*Warning: This page is about me being narcissistic.* Iâ€™m Jayson Tian, and I have this website up as a place to record my **hobbies**, things I've **learned**, and my **thoughts**. I want to keep a digital account of my high school life so I can look back it in the future (like in uni).

I spent some time trying to make this website look nice and simple. I believe in minimalism and I also enjoy learning about web design and development (It's kinda cool).
