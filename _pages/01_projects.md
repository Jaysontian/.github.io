# Projects

This page contains the things that I've been working on recently. In terms of coding, I have been focusing on Javascript mostly and also learning a bit of Java, Python, and C# on the side. I find that most of the things I do on the web and learning about computer science mostly focuses on more applicable topics rather than learning about every detail. I also upload recent music and artwork here.

## Recent Work
