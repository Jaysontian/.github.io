# Projects

This page contains most of my work. I just want to keep stuff here no matter if its done or not, successful or failed, so I can reflect back on it and see my changes and growth.

## Recent Work

- [ðŸ¥› Milk Corp](https://jaysontian.github.io/data/Milkcorp/site/index.html) - A desktop incremental game exploring the math and logic behind the idle genre. Click cows to create more milk!
- [Forgotten Promises](https://soundcloud.com/picxight-productions/forgotten-promises) - A nostalgic solo guitar piece with a bittersweet vibe.

## Music

I like to [compose music](https://soundcloud.com/picxight-productions) when I'm bored. I like to make calming piano and guitar pieces, but I also experiment with other genres.
