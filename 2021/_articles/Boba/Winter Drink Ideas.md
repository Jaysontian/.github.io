Winter approaches and as we pack up the candles from Thanksgiving dinner and begin to decorate trees and hang stockings above the fireplace, it's **necessary** to consider the additions we can make to traditional bubble tea recipes to complement the exciting holidays impending upon us.

Some touches and variations that I have seen in previous years are usually all inspired by western drinks. For example, looking at the flavor of peppermint, it is integrated with a variety of caffinated drinks and espressos. Take Starbucks for example, every winter they introduce a series of drinks that are peppermint based. On the other hand, hot chocolate is the go-to for warmth after getting freezed up by the cold Canadian weather.

## Peppermint

How do these ideas apply to milk tea? For one, peppermint is also a popular flavor in tea. However, it's sharp and pungnant flavor is served without creamer as the clash between the two flavors is not one that satisfies the taste buds. However, by using a lighter form of cream, such as cocunut milk or low fat milk, I think interesting results can be made. 

## Chocolate

I always feel that chocolate in milk tea is quite a contentious and questionable mixture. However, ever since attempting the Tiramisu Milk Tea from the Alley, I now believe that with a careful pairing, chocolate is a good "topping" for stronger drinks. A creative tea may be to infuse a latte based white chocolate drink (similar to what is served at Aroma Espresso) and then use that as the **creamer** for the drink. Technically, it's taking down two-birds with one stone – the sweetner and cream is both integrated!

## Pumpkins

This one might be for more of the autumn fans, but I feel that it's still worth including. The pumpkin spice latte has always been the popular go-to for a fall-themed drink that warms the heart when studying at a coffee shop. Therefore, I recently attempted to make a **pumpkin spice milk tea**. The main tea variety that I thought of immediately was  Thai tea leaves. Thai tea incorporates a fusion of spices and ingredients, mainly based off a mix of traditional and asian inspired plant varieties:

* **Ceylon** (Locally grown as landrace) – For Thai tea leaves, only traditional wild tea leaves are used and it is known as *bai miang*
* **Star Anise** – this is almost equivalent to pepper and is widely used in asian cooking; when used in high quantities it gives a numbing effect to the taste buds 
* Orange Blossom Water
* Tamarind Seed (Crushed) – this is what gives the tea almost a cinammon like flavor

The combination of these spices produces a flavor that is very similar to the pumpkin spice latte components.

I started off by making a pumpkin puree. I first chopped up the pumpkins and boiled it in water with sugar and a hint of salt and cinammon. After 20 minutes, the pumpkins soften and become ready to be blended. Using a blender and some milk, the puree can be made with maximum *smoothness*. 

Add cinammon, milk, vanilla extract, and brown sugar (to your liking) and bring to a boil. Then add Thai tea leaves (you can purchase these at your local asian supermarket easily) once water has been boiled.

Strain and then incorporate the pumpkin puree. Then, use a steeper to whisk up milk. Top with whipped cream to your liking and some cinnamon powder.

Voilà. The tea version of the pumpkin spice latte. Enjoy and happy winter!
