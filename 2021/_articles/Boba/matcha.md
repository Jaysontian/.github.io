Yes, Matcha. There are many misconceptions about this unique tea variety. Simply explained, it is based off of green tea, but specific green tea leaves are used in traditional Japanese process of Matcha creation. 

Now, in modern cafés and even at Starbucks, we see the flavor of Matcha gain popularity and integrate with Western beverages. I think it's amazing that this mélange of cultural flavors is happening, but it's also important to take a glance back into the origins of this rather "traditional" tea form!

## It's Healthy Too!

According to the [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.SDG2016LEXv?), Japanese citizens have the longest lifespan due to their diet and special drinking habits. Japanese must know some secrets about how to live a long and happy life. The miracle green matcha tea is one of them.

The bright green color of Matcha tea is a powder that occurs because the Camellia sinensis leaves are kept in the shade during its final stages of growth. It leads to a vast increase in chlorophyll, making the Matcha powder extremely green and providing tons of health benefits.

## Types of Matcha

Not all matcha is created equally and it can be quite confusing. Generally, the more expensive the matcha, the higher the quality. The main difference is the youth of the green tea plants: the youngest plants produce a more sweeter, intense, rich and mellow flavor which is used for ceremonial matcha. Older plants are used to make culinary matcha.

- **Ceremonial matcha,** because of its pure, sweet flavor is used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies where they make *koicha* – a type of thick matcha. Because koicha is so intense, only the best matcha can be used because it’s only ever mixed with water and never used for lattes or in desserts or food. Essentially, ceremonial matcha has nothing to hide behind. Still, even within ceremonial matcha, there are various grades available.
- **Culinary matcha** is usually what is used for cakes, cookies, and other sweets or foods. Culinary matcha are usually harvested from older plants in the fall. Again, there are various grades of culinary matcha and because there’s no standard of grading, culinary matcha can range from very good to not so good at all.

## Easy Recipe

1. **Heat** – Warm bowl by pouring in hot water and then drying with a cloth
2. **Sift and Shake** – Pour in Matcha, usually 2 tbsps is enough
3. **Water** – Mix with hot water – ideal temp is usually 80 celcius
4. **Whisk** – Self-explanatory
5. **Ice and Milk** – if you like a cold version, serve on top of latte foam or iced milk
