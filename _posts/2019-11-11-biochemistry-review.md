## Biochemistry Review Questions

<details><summary>How common are the elements that living systems are made out of?  What are these elements?</summary>
<p>

> Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen

</p></details>

<details><summary>Explain the cause of molecular polarity. </summary>
<p>

> Molecular polarity occurs when there is an unequal sharing of covalent bonding electrons between two non-metals. When one has a greater/stronger electronegativity (hold of electrons) than another, a polar bond occurs.

<details><summary>Why are radioactive elements useful for the study of biological systems?  </summary>
<p>

> Scientists can tag specific molecules without alternating the structure or function of the studied compounds.

<details><summary>Explain how the structure of water molecules account for each of the following properties and are useful for living systems.  </summary>
<p>

| **Property of Water**                   | **How does H2O molecular structure  account for this property?** | **Where / How is this property useful for  living systems?** |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cohesion                                | Attraction of  water to itself due to hydrogen bonds         | Surface tension: eg. Water strider                           |
| Adhesion                                | Water is polar  and climbs on surfaces that are more polar than itself | Capillary action (water in xylem)                            |
| High Specific  Heat                     | Takes lots of  thermal energy to break hydrogen bonds        | Minimizes changes in temperature (water used to distribute  heat) |
| Specific heat of  Vaporization          | Takes high energy  for hydrogen bonds to be broken into gas  | Evaporative cooling (kinetic energy leaves body, average  kinetic decreases hence cooler. |
| Floating Ice                            | As water is  frozen it expands making it less dense          | Ice floating to keep organisms alive in the winter           |
| -      Good  Solvent Properties         | -      Due to  polarity water is able to form electrostatic interactions with other polar  molecules or ions. | -    Carries valuable material and  nutrients, minerals for organisms |
| -      Dissociation  of Water Molecules | -      Allows  dissociation of salt, ions, and other polar molecules | -    Leads to acids and bases  which allows pH alteration    |

<details><summary>Why is carbon central to the structure of all biological molecules?   </summary>
<p>

> It has four valence electrons which means it can form single, double, and triple bonds! That means many elements can bond to it. Carbon-carbon bonds are extremely strong.

</p></details>

<details><summary>What are functional groups and why are they important in biochemistry?</summary>
<p>

> They act as chemical motifs and their presence allows us to predict properties and behaviours of those molecules.
