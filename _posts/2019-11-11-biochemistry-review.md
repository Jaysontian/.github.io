**Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen**  

</p></details>

<details><summary>Explain the cause of molecular polarity. </summary>
<p>

**Molecular polarity occurs when there is an unequal sharing of covalent bonding electrons between two non-metals. When one has a greater/stronger electronegativity (hold of electrons) than another, a polar bond occurs.**    

</p></details>

<details><summary>Why are radioactive elements useful for the study of biological systems?  </summary>
<p>

**Scientists can tag specific molecules without alternating the structure or function of the studied compounds.**
