I've been seriously having a crisis with the idea of productivity and mindsets. I'm honestly seeking solace from trying to believe everybody in this world would happen to stumble across some sort of this small hiccup in their career but I'm having trouble buying it.

Being productive is good. Procastinating and being non-efficient is bad. This is the typical culture and mindset developed by not just soceity but since the beginning of human existance (I'm pretty sure). Notably, coming from a chinese background does not help as diligence and perseverence are one of the most valued traits in chinese tradition and culture - although I'm inclined to believe my current crisis has little to do with my background. This preconceived notion of being productive has a grey area - as I have discovered through the long November break. I'm just sitting at home, watching TV, doing my typical school work, when this wave of weird thoughts hit me about the idea of being productive. I suddenly had a thought, questioning the extent to which productivity actually leads to successful outcomes and how this should be balanced.
