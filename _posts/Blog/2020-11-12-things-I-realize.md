There are so many important things in our lives that go unnoticed. Not necessarily from a philosophical point of view, but more of a mindset approach on getting things done. There's so many things we perceive and recognize but it never is processed in our brain. Might sound abstract, but it may make more sense when put in examples. I honestly thought about it, and I can lsit so many thigns that are underacknowledged.

## Routines

Yep. We go through the same motions, activities, every single day yet we never really think about the bigger picture of the purpose behind these daily actions. I honestly believe it's because of how good humans are at adapting, but I wouldn't bet it all on that. It's that sometimes we are so caught in the bustle of life that it's hard to recognize where the true goals and desires lie.
