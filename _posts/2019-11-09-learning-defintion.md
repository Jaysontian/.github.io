Recently, I have been thinking a lot about personal growth and achievement. Of course, the adage of how the journey is more beutiful than the destination is true, it can't be denied that sometimes achievement really does matter.

For me personally, I have been a more achiever kind of guy more than the journey for about as long as I've known my goals for. There's the obvious truth and feeling that you are the 'best' when you have the greatest achievement. It is this type of thinking that has shaped our classrooms, work environments, and current society. We are always striving higher, competing with each other to see who has more achievement or a better outcome. 

Don't get me wrong- competition can be beneficial and great in its own way, but it's the balance between self-growth and achievement that's is the most difficult to obtain.
