# What is Matcha?

Matcha is an app that I built for my friend because Wunderlist is going away.

The goal of this app is to provide a clean, simple interface for users to store tasks, yet customizable to have more complex features.

Inspirations of this app include minimalist apps such as Notion, Bear, and Mochi.

## Planned

- Filter/Sorting System
- Task Animation when Complete
- Dropdown from Label
- Improved Color Labeling System
- Context Menu Fixes
- Date Detection Response
- Data Deletion Confirmation
- Logbook Task Restoration
- More Views
- Task Details, Notes, Reminders
- Mobile version

# Changelog
