## What is Matcha?

matcha is a program that I built for my friend because wundelist is apparently switching over to Microsoft todo, and there are a lot of disadvantages of this change. Microsoft to do isn't the simplest todo app out there.

Wunderlist was amazing because of it's flexibility in customization as well as simplicity to use. One can just quickly type up a task and record it. Microsoft Todo, on the other hand, has a lot to work with in that department.

Hence, I made my own todo app!
