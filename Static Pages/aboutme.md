# About Me
Hey. I’m Jayson, and I have this website up because I want to record my **hobbies**, things I've **learned**, and my random **thoughts**.

Since this page is about me, I’ll be as narcissistic as possible.

- Complete my long Netflix To-Watch list, top three including:
	- Suits
	- The Good Doctor
	- Finish B99 [:)][1]
- Watch amazing horror movies especially w friends in theatres. Favourites these past two years:
	- Hereditary
	- Midsommar
	- A Silent Voice
	- Get Out and Us
	- It (It 2 was a disappointment)
- Drink, review, and strive to find the best milk tea in the world.
	- Probs gonna start a milk tea blog soon w a friend
- Waste time on tiktok
- Finish good incremental games like [this one][2], [this one][3], and [this one][4] or games that use up the least amount of brain cells.
- Spend more time sorting music and making playlists instead of listening to it on [Spotify][5].
- Reading psychology or biology cool stuff (including [corona][6])
- I can't for the life of me keep Snapchat streaks for more than a week.

## Future Blog Ideas

- Milk tea in the GTA
- Rating horror movies and talking about psychological horror
- Building a jekyll site
- Cheatsheet for the minimal amount of steps to make an electron application
- Setting up Google API's, firebase, and firestore minimal steps
- learning mindset
- Incremental games - theory, game design, logic, and math
- Music harmony and progression of music chord / styles in generations
- Productivity and School
- Developing interests and extracurriculars
- life stuff that’s deep and nonsense
