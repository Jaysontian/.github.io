      <h2>TOPBAR AND BACKGROUND ANIMATIONS </h2>
      <h3> April 4, 2019 </h3>
      <p>I decided to start wodking on the topbar and background first. I used keyframes to animated the leaves in the background. I had trouble with z-indexes because my divs were not organized. I made a footer as well with sign in and parent buttons (placeholders that will do nothing). As the user hovers over the topbar or the menu icon, the side navigation will show. </p> <p> Next I am going to get the buttons working. I am also going to start working on the main information page which displays the data in a interactive manner.</p>

      <h2>SIDE NAVIGATION MENU </h2>
      <h3> March 31, 2019 </h3>
      <p>I completed the side navigation menu. My original design was a side menu that was fixed on the screen. I decided that the side menu will only show if the user either clicks or hovers over a certain element. The side navigation will also be in the theme of branches, as my original design 3 stated. Another change I made was that I decided to organize the information through category instead of just a jumble of media (likely will confuse the student). The splash page is where the student can access all the pages of the site in an organized manner.</p><p> My next step is to start making interactive buttons. I'm thinking of putting an animation in the background so that the site will be more interesting to look at appearence wise.

      <h2>REDESIGNED SLASH PAGE </h2>
      <h3> March 28, 2019 </h3>
      <p>I fishined designing the main page as of what elements I would like to use and where I would like to place it. I think for a kids site a splash page would be extremely helpful because it organizes the information in way a kid would understand. I also decided that the entire theme would be about trees and the color palette of the page would be mostly green, brown, and other more bright colors. GIF's would also be interesting.</p>
      <p> My next step will be starting to make a navigation menu and buttons.</p>
