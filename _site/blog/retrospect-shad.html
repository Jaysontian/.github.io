          <p>Hung on the set of doors which lead to the locker rooms at school, the SHAD promotional poster first caught my eye in year 9. At the time, I had no idea what I was interested in. But after a few classes in coding and a couple of sessions at the design lab, my heart was set: I knew I wanted to learn more about STEAM in some way. I was intrigued to explore the intersections of tech and science.</p>

<p>For the rest of the year, the poster remained on that door. It nagged at me, as I passed by every time, trying to convince me that it would be an interesting program, albeit seeming too “nerdy” or academically focused for a summer activity. But by the time year 10 rolled around, I decided to apply.</p>

<h2 id="waiting">Waiting</h2>

<p>Looking back, I think my responses to the application questions were probably extremely questionable, as it was my first time doing any sort of “application” for a summer program. But after some edits and advice from friends, I sent it in, totally surprised when I heard I made it a few weeks after the winter break.</p>

<p>However, the pandemic came, and with it came emails of program cancellations and then the sudden decision to run it virtually the year after. And so I waited for another year. By the time I was half-way through grade 11, the excitement for the program had already faded; I spent the winter applying to more programs and taking on other initiatives. SHAD 2021 was at the back of my mind.</p>

<h2 id="unexpected-attendance">Unexpected Attendance</h2>

<p>I was not expecting to attend SHAD. I was either going to do an internship (if I was hired) or get a job somewhere . I felt that, considering it’s the summer before grade 12, I needed to step it up and learn to work in the “real” world.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t know if it’s just laziness or just burnout from the past school year, but in the end, I decided to still do it. My mindset going in: if I hate it, I can just dip half-way through. But now, after experiencing it, I can say it was totally different than what I expected – in both good and bad ways. Overall, though, it was a <strong>phenomenal</strong> “learning” experience.</p>

<h2 id="takeaway-1-hello---business---world">Takeaway 1: Hello - Business - World</h2>

<p>Going in, I completely believed SHAD focused on engineering, sciences, and math. I was very wrong. Every year, program directors choose a global theme that needs to be addressed. For the rest of the month, the students must design a solution to address that issue.</p>

<p>Believing this was “science” focused was the first mistake I made (as well as everyone in my design group). Reflecting on the entire experience, the program really did focus heavily on “design”, which took away copious time for people to individually connect and form friendships. However, aside from that flaw (as well as the cliché water theme we received), the project itself is not too bad in theory.</p>

<p>Seeing the design world through “science”, especially as someone who focuses on CS, Bio, and Behavioural Sciences is problematic. Only until the last day of the program, our entire group realized how essential the entrepreneurial side was to the overall success of the design.</p>
